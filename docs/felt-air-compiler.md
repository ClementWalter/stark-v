# A felt language that compiles to AIR (design)

## The observation

Write-once (single-assignment) memory with Cairo-style call frames is already a
circuit description. Each frame only references values in the window
`[fp - arg_size, fp + frame_size)`; every cell is written exactly once as a felt
expression of earlier cells. That is precisely a row of an AIR table: the
frame's cells are the columns, the write expressions are the wires, and a
"function" is a reusable sub-circuit. The Cairo VM's memory model is not an
execution detail — it is the reason Cairo programs _define_ AIRs instead of
merely running on one.

So instead of writing components as flattened column lists plus hand-named
intermediates, we should write them as straight-line felt code and compile to
the AIR, with the **maximum constraint degree as a compiler parameter**.

## What the compiler does

The program is felt-valued single-assignment code over the table's input
columns. The compiler builds the expression DAG and decides, per node, whether
it stays **inline** (a derived expression, free) or is **materialized** (a
committed trace column plus one equality constraint):

- Multiplication compounds degree: `x * y * z` at `max_degree = 2` splits into
  `t = x * y` (materialized, constraint `t - x * y`) and the inline `t * z`.
- Addition does not: `a + b + c + d` stays one inline expression no matter its
  length — it never increases the degree.
- Reuse counts: a degree-2 subexpression used by ten constraints may be cheaper
  materialized once than inlined ten times into the composition evaluation; the
  compiler weighs (columns added) against (constraint degree and evaluation
  cost).

The output is exactly what `define_trace_tables!` consumes today: a column list
(inputs + materialized intermediates), `derived:` (the inline nodes),
`constraints:` (the materialization equalities plus the program's asserted
zeros), and `lookups:` (relation calls in the code become LogUp entries).

The same program is the witness generator: run it with concrete `PackedM31`
values and every materialized node _is_ the column fill, in the same order. This
is the existing `T`-generic trick (one expression, evaluated with `E::F` for the
AIR and `PackedM31` via `at(i)` for the witness) taken to its conclusion — the
macro already proves the architecture works; the compiler adds control flow and
automatic materialization on top.

## Poseidon2, the motivating case

Today the poseidon2 table is ~700 hand-flattened columns
(`full0_sq1_0..15, full0_sq2_0..15, full0_mix_0..15, full1_...`) and the one
remaining hand-written component module, because the expression DSL cannot loop.
As felt code it is:

```text
fn poseidon2(state: [felt; 16]) -> [felt; 16] {
    for round in 0..8 {                       // static bound: unrolled
        state = add_round_constants(state, EXTERNAL[round]);
        for i in 0..16 { state[i] = sbox(state[i]); }   // x^5
        state = external_mix(state);          // additive: stays inline
    }
    // ... partial rounds ...
    state
}

fn sbox(x: felt) -> felt {
    x ** 5
}
```

At `max_degree = 3` the compiler materializes two cells per s-box instead of
today's hand-chosen three (`sq1`, `sq2`, `mix`), derives the column count, the
constraints, and the witness fill — and changing the degree budget re-derives
all three. The flattened table becomes generated output, not source.

## Control flow: the calling convention is a LogUp relation

The Cairo frame layout completes the model. A call frame receives its inputs at
`[fp - n, fp - 3)` and leaves its outputs at the final `[ap - m, ap - 1)`; the
two remaining slots — `fp - 2` (saved fp) and `fp - 1` (return pc) — are pure
control-flow plumbing. In the AIR view those two slots disappear entirely: LogUp
replaces sequencing. What remains per activation is exactly one natural tuple,
`(inputs..., outputs...)`, and that tuple **is** the function's relation.

- Each function is an AIR table; each activation (call) is one row.
- A row starts by **consuming** its own activation tuple
  (`-enabler * fn_io(args..., rets...)`) and its constraints enforce
  `rets = body(args)`.
- A caller **emits** the tuple for every call it makes
  (`+enabler * callee_io(call_args..., call_rets...)`) — the returned values are
  witness columns in the caller's frame, received through the relation, and the
  callee's constraints are what make them right.
- A recursive call is the same emission against the function's own relation:
  rows of one AIR consuming and emitting each other, telescoping exactly like
  the recursion crate's `merkle_node` paths and `sponge_step` chains.
- The program's public interface is the entry activations: the verifier emits
  `+fn_io(inputs, outputs)` as public claim terms (the `RootClaim` pattern), and
  the whole multiset must cancel.

Purity makes the unkeyed tuple sound: a function is a relation in the
mathematical sense, so two activations with the same inputs have the same
outputs and collapse into multiplicity — no call-site nonce needed.

The codebase already runs on this pattern without naming it: the opcode tables
are "functions" consuming `program_access` and `memory_access` tuples;
`poseidon2_io(in16, out16)` is precisely an activation tuple; the recursion
circuit's `op_def`/`wire` relations are call frames for QM31 arithmetic. The
language makes the pattern first-class: `let c = cube(a)` in source compiles to
a column `c`, an emission into `cube`'s relation, and a row in `cube`'s table —
wiring, table layout, and witness fill all from one line.

## Relation to the current DSL (incremental path)

The expression DSL already has: single-assignment named intermediates
(`derived:`), expansion-time constant folding (`pow2`, `inv`, integer subtrees),
spec-shaped lookups, and the dual AIR/witness evaluation. What it lacks is
exactly what the compiler adds:

1. **Degree-budget materialization** (smallest step, immediately useful): today
   a derived column that would breach the bound must be manually split into a
   real trace column (the div carry chain stayed at degree 2 only by careful
   hand-shaping, and two pre-existing degree-4 groups in div shipped unnoticed
   until the first real-row proof — see commit e55578ff). Let the macro compute
   each expression's degree and either reject with "materialize this" or
   auto-materialize. Auto-materialization changes the table layout, so the macro
   must also emit the fill — which it can, since the fill is the same expression
   evaluated concretely.
2. **Static control flow**: `for` with constant bounds (unroll), `if` on
   compile-time flags (select). This is enough to absorb poseidon2 and delete
   the last hand-written component.
3. **Functions/frames**: reusable sub-circuits with the Cairo frame rule — a
   callee reads only its arguments, writes only its frame. At this point the
   language is a real (if minimal) felt language, and per the opening
   observation it could in principle be _executed_ on a write-once-memory VM as
   well as compiled to the AIR.

Step 1 hardens soundness today; step 2 removes the poseidon2 exception; step 3
is the full language. Each step keeps the single-source invariant: AIR, witness,
and (through the recursion recorder) the final proof all derive from the same
definition.

Steps 2 and the function-call relation are no longer hypothetical:
`define_air_fns!` ships them (static `for`/`map`/`sum`, inline functions,
auto-materialized s-box chains under `max_degree`, the `fn_io` activation
relation, `embedded:` flag columns, and `embedded_component:` integration into
the prover composition). Poseidon2 is defined through it in
`air/src/poseidon2.rs`. What remains is step 4 below: making the opcode AIRs —
and therefore the runner — expressible in the same language.

## Step 4: migrating the opcode AIRs (the runner rewrite)

Target state: one function per opcode family, whose body **is** simultaneously
the executable semantics (the runner calls `call_lui` and gets the right
result), the witness fill (the call pushes the table row), and the AIR (the same
body compiled to constraints). `define_air!`'s
`committed/derived/constraints/lookups` schema, the `components!` composition
macro, and the hand-written opcode handlers in `runner/src/ops/` all collapse
into these function definitions.

What `define_air_fns!` is missing for opcodes, in dependency order:

1. **External relation statements.** ✅ _Implemented._ A system declares
   `relation name(arity);` at the top and function bodies use `emit name(args)`
   / `consume name(args)`; the entry is threaded through the same single-source
   `evaluation()` seam and the positional entry→relation mapping, drawn as an
   `AirFnRelations` field, and balanced across the proof. See the
   `extern_relation` tests in `crates/stwo-macros/tests/air_fns.rs` (a `source`
   function emits `pass(x)`, a `sink` consumes it, and the relation cancels).
   What remains is wiring the _specific_ zkVM relations (`program_access`,
   `memory_access`, `registers_state`, range checks) — i.e. an opcode body
   reads:

   The schema entry

   ```text
   lui: {
       committed: { clock, pc, rd, imm_0, imm_1, imm_2 },
       derived: {
           imm: imm_0 + pow2(4) * imm_1 + pow2(12) * imm_2,
           pc_next: pc + 4, clock_next: clock + 1,
           rd_val_1: imm_0 * pow2(4),
           rd_clock_diff: clock - rd_clock_prev,
       },
       lookups: {
           -enabler * program_access(pc, LUI, rd_addr, imm, 0),
           -enabler * registers_state(pc, clock),
           enabler * registers_state(pc_next, clock_next),
           -enabler * range_check_8_8_4(imm_1, imm_2, imm_0),
           -enabler * memory_access(0, rd_addr, rd_clock_prev, rd_prev_0, ...),
           enabler * memory_access(0, rd_addr, clock, 0, rd_val_1, imm_1, imm_2),
           -enabler * range_check_20(rd_clock_diff),
       },
   }
   ```

   becomes a function whose parameters are the access tuple and whose body reads
   naturally:

   ```text
   fn lui(clock, pc, rd: Reg, imm_0, imm_1, imm_2) {
       range_check_8_8_4(imm_1, imm_2, imm_0);
       let imm = imm_0 + 2**4 * imm_1 + 2**12 * imm_2;
       consume program_access(pc, LUI, rd.addr, imm, 0);
       rd.write(clock, [0, imm_0 * 2**4, imm_1, imm_2]);
       step registers_state(pc -> pc + 4, clock -> clock + 1);
   }
   ```

   `Reg` is sugar for the 10-column access bundle (`addr`, `prev_0..3`,
   `clock_prev`, …) plus the paired `memory_access` consume/emit and the
   `range_check_20` clock-diff check — the pattern every opcode repeats today.
   `step` is sugar for the `registers_state` consume/emit pair. Range checks are
   statements, not lookups the author signs.

2. **Witness-side access resolution.** `rd.write(...)` on the fill path must ask
   the VM for `prev`/`clock_prev` — i.e. call
   `Tracer::trace_reg_access`/`trace_mem_access` (gap-filling included). The
   generated `call_lui(vm, pc, imm…)` therefore takes the machine state, not raw
   felts: the function body is the _only_ place opcode semantics are written,
   and `runner/src/ops/upper.rs` (and friends) are deleted. The clock catch-up
   rows become activations of a generated `clock_gap` function, which retires
   the hand-written `air::clock::ClockGapTable` (its layout is pinned to the
   generated columns by `crates/air/tests/clock_layout.rs` until then — we
   deliberately did NOT extend `define_air!` with a push-by-`Access` table API,
   because this step supersedes it).

3. **Witness hints.** ✅ _Implemented._ `hint name = expr;` declares a
   prover-chosen committed column, free in the AIR (the body constrains it with
   `assert`s) and filled by evaluating `expr` on the witness path — for the
   carry bits, sign decompositions, and `diff_inv` markers opcodes commit but do
   not derive in-row. See `test_hint_*` in
   `crates/stwo-macros/tests/air_fns.rs`.

4. **Dispatch.** Opcode families with flag columns (`base_alu_reg`'s
   add/sub/xor/or/and) are one function with a one-hot flag parameter and
   `if`-on-flag selects — already expressible with the static control flow. The
   decode step stays in the runner (`air::instructions`); it just calls the
   right generated function.

The capabilities (1) and (3) are in place, and the `mini_vm` test in
`crates/stwo-macros/tests/air_fns.rs` exercises the whole target shape on a toy:
opcodes as functions (`step`), the `(pc, clock)` state carried by an external
`reg_state` relation that telescopes across rows, a `boundary` function closing
the chain, and a `hint`-backed witness column — proven and verified, with a
broken chain rejected. What remains for the _production_ migration is
whole-system: the access values come from the runner's `Tracer` (passed in as
the mini-VM passes `pc`/`clock`, computed by
`trace_reg_access`/`trace_mem_access`), the range checks resolve against the
preprocessed tables, and the rv32im `Relations` (`program_access`,
`memory_access`, `registers_state`) replace the toy `reg_state` — at which point
each opcode family migrates one PR at a time, its constraints checked by the
existing e2e tests, until the `components!` entry and `runner/src/ops/` are
deleted.

### What this retires (the `components!` question)

`components!` is not redundant with `define_air!` — it generates the composition
layer (per-opcode `air`/`witness` modules, `Claim`, `Components`, trace
orchestration) that `define_air!` deliberately does not, because the composition
needs prover-side stwo types the air crate does not depend on. But
`define_air_fns!` with `embedded_component: true` already generates exactly that
composition for poseidon2. The retirement path is therefore not "merge
`components!` into `define_air!`" but:

1. land steps 1–3 above and migrate one simple opcode (`lui`) end to end —
   function in the air crate, generated component in the prover, handler deleted
   from the runner;
2. migrate the remaining families one PR each (the LogUp balance is checked by
   the existing e2e constraint tests at every step);
3. when the last family is out of `define_air!`'s opcode list, delete
   `components!` (~1000 lines), the `define_air!` opcode syntax, and
   `runner/src/ops/`.

Until then `components!` stays; any interim investment in it (or in new
`define_air!` surface) should be weighed against this plan.

## Open questions

- **Materialization vs masks**: stwo also allows referencing neighboring rows
  (masks). A frame that reads its caller's cells maps naturally to a mask
  offset; deciding when a value crosses rows vs stays in-row is a layout
  question the compiler eventually owns.
- **Lookup placement**: relation calls inside loops/functions multiply entries;
  the batching parameter (`batch:`) should become a per-entry degree decision
  the compiler makes (quadratic denominators → singleton), not a table-level
  annotation.
- **Cost model**: columns are committed (Merkle + FRI cost per column); inline
  expressions cost composition-evaluation work. The right objective is prover
  time, with max_degree as the hard constraint.
